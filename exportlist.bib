   abstract = {Wireless communications has witnessed a tremendous growth during the past decade and further spectacular enabling technology advances are expected in an effort to render ubiquitous wireless connectivity a reality. Currently, a technical in-depth book on this subject is unavailable, which has a similar detailed exposure of OFDM, MIMO-OFDM and MC-CDMA. A further attraction of the joint treatment of these topics is that it allows the reader to view their design trade-offs in a comparative context. <u>Divided into three main parts:</u> Part I provides a detailed exposure of OFDM designed for employment in various applications Part II is another design alternative applicable in the context of OFDM systems where the channel quality fluctuations observed are averaged out with the aid of frequency-domain spreading codes, which leads to the concept of MC-CDMA Part III discusses how to employ multiple antennas at the base station for the sake of supporting multiple users in the uplink By providing an all-encompassing self-contained treatment this volume will appeal to a wide readership, as it is both an easy-reading textbook and a high-level research monograph.},

   abstract = {"Professor Andreas F. Molisch, renowned researcher and educator, has put together a comprehensive, clear, and authoritative book on wireless communications. The Second Edition, which includes a wealth of new material on important emerging topics, ensures the book will continue to be a key resource for every student, researcher, and practitioner in the field." Professor Moe Win, MIT, USA Wireless communications has grown rapidly over the past decade from a niche market into one of the most important, fast moving industries. Fully updated to incorporate the latest research and developments, Wireless Communications, Second Edition provides an authoritative overview of the principles and applications of mobile communication technology. The author provides an in-depth analysis of current treatment of the area, addressing both the traditional elements, such as Rayleigh fading, BER in flat fading channels, and equalization, and more recently emerging topics like multi-user detection in CDMA systems, MIMO systems, and cognitive radio. The dominant wireless standards, including cellular, cordless and wireless LANs, are discussed. * Topics featured include: wireless propagation channels, transceivers and signal processing, multiple access and advanced transceiver schemes, and standardized wireless systems. * Combines mathematical descriptions with intuitive explanations of the physical facts, enabling readers to acquire a deep understanding of the subject. * Includes new chapters on cognitive radio, cooperative communications and relaying, video coding, 3GPP Long Term Evolution, and WiMax
plus significant new sections on multi-user MIMO, 802.11n, and information theory. * Companion website featuring: solutions manual and presentation slides for instructors, appendices, list of abbreviations and other useful resources.},
