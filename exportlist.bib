   abstract = {Wireless communications has witnessed a tremendous growth during the past decade and further spectacular enabling technology advances are expected in an effort to render ubiquitous wireless connectivity a reality. Currently, a technical in-depth book on this subject is unavailable, which has a similar detailed exposure of OFDM, MIMO-OFDM and MC-CDMA. A further attraction of the joint treatment of these topics is that it allows the reader to view their design trade-offs in a comparative context. <u>Divided into three main parts:</u> Part I provides a detailed exposure of OFDM designed for employment in various applications Part II is another design alternative applicable in the context of OFDM systems where the channel quality fluctuations observed are averaged out with the aid of frequency-domain spreading codes, which leads to the concept of MC-CDMA Part III discusses how to employ multiple antennas at the base station for the sake of supporting multiple users in the uplink By providing an all-encompassing self-contained treatment this volume will appeal to a wide readership, as it is both an easy-reading textbook and a high-level research monograph.},

   title = {A Comparison of CP-OFDM, PCC-OFDM and UFMC for 5G Uplink Communications},
   journal = {IEEE access},
   volume = {7},
   pages = {157574-157594},
   abstract = {Polynomial-cancellation-coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (PCC-OFDM) is a form of OFDM that has waveforms which are very well localized in both the time and frequency domains and so it is ideally suited for use in the 5G network. This paper analyzes the performance of PCC-OFDM in the uplink of a multiuser system using orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and compares it with conventional cyclic prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM), and universal filtered multicarrier (UFMC). PCC-OFDM is shown to be very much less sensitive to time and frequency offsets than either CP-OFDM or UFMC. For a given constellation size, PCC-OFDM in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) requires 3 dB lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a given bit-error-rate, and the SNR advantage of PCC-OFDM increases rapidly when there are timing and/or frequency offsets. For PCC-OFDM no frequency guard-band is required between different OFDMA users. PCC-OFDM is completely compatible with CP-OFDM and adds negligible complexity and latency, because it uses a simple mapping of data onto pairs of subcarriers at the transmitter, and a simple weighting-and-adding of pairs of subcarriers at the receiver. The weighting-and-adding step, which has been omitted in some of the literature, is shown to contribute substantially to the SNR advantage of PCC-OFDM. A disadvantage of PCC-OFDM (without overlapping) is the potential reduction in spectral efficiency because subcarriers are modulated in pairs, but this reduction is more than regained because no guard band is required and because, for a given channel, larger constellations can be used.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a principle of orthogonal multiplexing for transmitting a number of data messages simultaneously through a linear band-limited transmission medium at a maximum data rate without interchannel and intersymbol interferences. A general method is given for synthesizing an infinite number of classes of band-limited orthogonal time functions in a limited frequency band. Stated in practical terms, the method permits the synthesis of a large class of practical transmitting filter characteristics for an arbitrarily given amplitude characteristic of the transmission medium. Rectangular-shaped ideal filters are not required. The synthesis procedure is convenient. Furthermore, the amplitude and the phase characteristics of the transmitting filters can be synthesized independently. Adaptive correlation reception can be used for data processing, since the received signals remain orthogonal no matter what the phase distortion is in the transmission medium. The system provides the same signal distance protection against channel noises as if the signals of each channel were transmitted through an independent medium and intersymbol interference in each channel were eliminated by reducing data rate.},
